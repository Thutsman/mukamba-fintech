## 🎯 What You Need To Do (15 Minutes)

### Step 1: Get Your Vonage Credentials (5 min)

1. Go to: https://dashboard.nexmo.com/
2. Find your **API Key** and **API Secret** on the dashboard
3. Copy both values

### Step 2: Configure Environment Variables

#### A. For Local Development:
Create a file called `.env.local` in your project root:

```bash
# SMS Provider
SMS_PROVIDER=vonage

# Vonage Credentials (from Step 1)
VONAGE_API_KEY=your-actual-api-key
VONAGE_API_SECRET=your-actual-api-secret
VONAGE_FROM_NUMBER=Mukamba
```

Then restart your dev server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

#### B. For Production (Vercel):

1. Go to: https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. Select your `mukamba-fintech` project
3. Go to: **Settings** → **Environment Variables**
4. Add these 4 variables (for ALL environments):

   - `SMS_PROVIDER` = `vonage`
   - `VONAGE_API_KEY` = `your-api-key`
   - `VONAGE_API_SECRET` = `your-api-secret`
   - `VONAGE_FROM_NUMBER` = `Mukamba`

5. **Redeploy** your application

### Step 3: Test It!

1. Go to your website
2. Try phone verification with `+263 779 035 404`
3. Check Vonage Dashboard → SMS → Logs for delivery status

---

## 📊 How to Verify It's Working

### ✅ Success Indicators:

1. **In Browser Console:**
   ```
   SMS Provider selected: vonage
   Vonage: Checking configuration... {hasKey: true, hasSecret: true, hasFrom: true}
   Vonage response status: 200
   ```

2. **In Vonage Dashboard:**
   - Go to SMS → Logs
   - See your sent message with status "delivered"

3. **On Your Phone:**
   - Receive SMS with 6-digit verification code

## ⚠️ Important Notes for Zimbabwe

Zimbabwe has strict SMS regulations that may affect delivery:

### Issue: Alphanumeric Sender IDs May Be Blocked
- Sender ID `"Mukamba"` might not work for Zimbabwean carriers
- Some carriers block alphanumeric sender IDs

### Solution: Purchase a Zimbabwe Virtual Number
1. Go to Vonage Dashboard → Numbers → Buy Numbers
2. Search for Zimbabwe (+263) numbers
3. Purchase a virtual number (~$1-5/month)
4. Update `VONAGE_FROM_NUMBER` to your purchased number:
   ```
   VONAGE_FROM_NUMBER=+263XXXXXXXXXX
   ```

### Alternative for Testing:
- Test with a South African number first: `+27XXXXXXXXX`
- If it works, the issue is Zimbabwe-specific regulations

## 🔍 Current System Architecture

Your SMS system is already built and ready! Here's how it works:

```
User clicks "Send Code"
    ↓
BuyerPhoneVerificationModal.tsx (Frontend)
    ↓
buyerServices.sendPhoneOTP() (Service Layer)
    ↓
POST /api/sms (API Route)
    ↓
sendSms() in sms-providers.ts
    ↓
sendViaVonage() function
    ↓
Vonage API (https://rest.nexmo.com/sms/json)
    ↓
SMS delivered to user's phone! ✅
```

The only missing piece is your Vonage credentials in the environment variables.

## 💰 Cost Estimate

With Vonage paid tier:
- **Outbound SMS to Zimbabwe**: ~$0.05-$0.08 per SMS
- **Virtual Number** (optional): ~$1-5/month
- **No monthly fees** for API usage

For 100 SMS verifications per month:
- Cost: ~$5-8/month
- Very affordable for your use case!

## 🐛 Troubleshooting Common Issues

### "Vonage not configured" Error
**Cause:** Environment variables not set
**Fix:** Add all 4 variables to Vercel + redeploy

### "Invalid credentials" Error
**Cause:** Wrong API Key or Secret
**Fix:** Copy exact values from Vonage Dashboard

### "502 Bad Gateway" Error
**Cause:** Environment variables not loaded (didn't redeploy)
**Fix:** Redeploy your Vercel application

### SMS Not Received
**Cause:** Sender ID blocked in Zimbabwe
**Fix:** Purchase a virtual Zimbabwe number from Vonage

   - Check dashboard regularly for costs
   - Set up spending alerts in Vonage

3. **Test thoroughly**
